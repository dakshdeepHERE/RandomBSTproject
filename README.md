# Random BST Project

We are given a task to create a Java console application that looks like the following when it is started:

BST Test Program
1. Generate Random BST
2. Display BST (PreOrder)
3. Display BST (InOrder
4. Display BST (PostOrder)

The program is based on a loop. When the user press 1 on the keyboard, the program generates 10 random integer numbers with values between 1 and 100 and store the numbers in the BST.
When the user press 2 on the keyboard, the program displays the BST in preorder format. When the user press 3 on the keyboard, the program displays the BST in inorder format. When the user press 4 on the keyboard, the program displays the BST in postorder format. You should take a screenshot for each case.
